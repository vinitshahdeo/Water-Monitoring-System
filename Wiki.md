Welcome to the Water-Monitoring-System wiki! It is an IOT based Liquid Level Monitoring system that has mechanisms to keep the user alerted in case of liquid overflow or when tank depletes. It is based on the idea of a smart city as we can reduce the wastage of water across the city by alerting the user about the overflow of water in the tank.

To know more about the project, you can view the demo [here](https://vinitshahdeo.github.io/Water-Monitoring-System/src/home.html)

# Goals
* To reduce wastage of water across the city.
* To provide better water supply to the people.
* Save Water, Save Life.

# Requirements
* AVR Family Controller
* LCD Screen
* Wifi modem
* A buzzer
* 12V transformer

The status of the system could be monitored by an LCD screen or a web page that
provides a brilliant graphical representation. Colors are used to depict various scenarios
with respect to the amount of liquid in the tanks or containers and the buzzer buzzes
when the limit exceeds the permissible quantity of fill.

# Implementation
The water monitoring system is an IoT based autonomous device which helps us to reduce the wastage of water by preventing its overflow. It can be implemented with the use of the following steps:

* The ultrasonic sensors will be installed on the water tank with the help of which we can measure liquid level container depth.
* The water level data can be seen on the thinkspeak server.
* To monitor the real-time level of water in the tank, a webpage is available where we can see the status of water in tanks.
* The colors depict the status of water in tanks.
* We can see the status of water on an LCD screen also.
* The buzzer starts buzzing whenever the limit exceeds the permissible quantity of fill.

# Conclusion

Water is a precious source of life. Without water there is no life, that's why there are various mesaures taken to conserve water. With the goal of **Save Water, Save Life** we have created a Water Monitoring system which uses IoT to detect the level of water in tanks and prevent the wastage of water. With the help of this system, we can see the status of our water tanks on a LCD screen or on a web page which displays graphical representation of tank. Colors are used to display the status of water in tank. With the help of Ultrasonic sensors and Deep sleep techique we will get to know the status of water in tanks.
