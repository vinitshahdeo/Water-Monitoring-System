# Contributing to Water Monitoring System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. From `develop` branch create feature branch
3. Work on the feature branch without taking pull
4. Write proper commit message and description.
5. Resolve Merge conflicts and assign respective mentor for reviewing.
4. Always create PR to `develop` branch.
5. Once your PR is merged, delete that branch.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
