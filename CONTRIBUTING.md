# Contributing to Water Monitoring System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. From `develop` branch create feature branch `eg: feature/button-overflow-fix`
3. Work on the feature branch without taking pull
4. Write proper commit message and description.
5. Resolve Merge conflicts and assign respective mentor for reviewing.
6. Always create PR to `develop` branch.
7. Once your PR is merged, delete that branch.
8. Make sure your code lints.
9. Issue that pull request!
