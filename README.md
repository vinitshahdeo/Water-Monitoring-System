Water Monitoring System is an IOT based Liquid Level Monitoring system that has the mechanism to keep the user alerted in case of liquid overflow or when tank depletes. The water tanks can be fixed with ultrasonic sensors that is placed over the container. Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure, compare container depth and liquid level.

The status of the system could be monitored by an LCD screen or a web page that provides a brilliant graphical representation. Colours are used to depict various scenarios with respect to the amount of liquid in the tanks or containers and the buzzer buzzes when the limit exceeds the permissible quantity of fill.

### Goals of this project :

- **_To reduce the wastage of water across the city_**
- **_To provide better water supply to the people_**

## Getting Started

[![GitHub code size in bytes](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=github)](https://vinitshahdeo.github.io/Water-Monitoring-System/) [![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?color=bluevoilet&logo=github)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/commits/) [![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=github)](https://vinitshahdeo.github.io/Water-Monitoring-System/)

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/) repository.
Click on the <a href="https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/24/000000/code-fork.png"></a> symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Water-Monitoring-System
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Water-Monitoring-System
```

**4.** Create a new branch.

```bash
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

**5.** Make changes in source code.

**6.** Stage your changes and commit

```bash
#Add changes to Index
git add .

#Commit to the local repo
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

>CAUTION: Synch up your local repo with [original repo](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System) (Upstream) before pushing your commits.
>This avoids unnecessary conflicts during the merge.

>NOTE: You can do so by adding a [remote handler](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/syncing) reference to the original repo and pull the changes from the respective branch.
>Resolve the [merge-conflicts](https://www.atlassian.com/de/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts) if any.

>TIPS: [Workflow diagram](git-workflow.svg)
>```bash
>#Add upstream repo
>git remote add upstream https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System.git
>
>#Disable accidental push to the upstream
>git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
>
>#List the remote repo and fetch references
>git remote -v && git fetch upstream
>
>#Check for any new commits in the upstream branch
>git log HEAD..upstream/master #No output indicates, upstream has not moved ahead
>
>#See the patch difference between local and upstream branch
>git diff -p HEAD..upstream/master
>
>```

>CAUTION: If the upstream has moved ahead, rebase your commit and resolve conflicts if any. [Skip otherwise]
>```bash
>git rebase upstream/master
>```
>

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repo.

```bash
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

**8.** Create a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) !

**9.** **Congratulations!** Sit and relax, you've made your contribution to [Water Monitoring System](https://vinitshahdeo.github.io/Water-Monitoring-System/) project.

## Contribution Guidelines

[![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-raw/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/compare) [![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=github)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/graphs/contributors) [![Vinit Shahdeo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-@vinitshahdeo-gray.svg?colorA=gray&colorB=dodgerblue&logo=github)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/)

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).

- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) for more info)

- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at [here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))

- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

- Please follow the [PR Template](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to create the PR.

- Always create PR to `develop` branch.

- Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- Refer [this](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
