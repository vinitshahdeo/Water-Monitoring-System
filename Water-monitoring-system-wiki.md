# Introduction
Water Monitoring System is an IOT based Liquid Level Monitoring system that has mechanisms to keep the user alerted in case of liquid overflow or when tank depletes. The water tanks can be fixed with ultrasonic sensors that are placed over the container. The ultrasonic sensor is used to measure, compare container depth and liquid level.

The status of the system could be monitored by an LCD screen or a web page that provides a brilliant graphical representation. Colors are used to depict various scenarios with respect to the amount of liquid in the tanks or containers, and the buzzer buzzes when the limit exceeds the permissible quantity of fill.

# Goals
The primary goal of this project is to make efficient use of water across the city. This project will help us to make use of technology for conserving natural resources. 
We can use this system to keep track of the water consumption and depletion over some time, and thus analyze its usage.  

# Hardware Used

# Contribution Guidelines

![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-raw/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=git&logoColor=white) ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System?logo=github) [![Vinit Shahdeo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-@vinitshahdeo-gray.svg?colorA=gray&colorB=dodgerblue&logo=github)](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/)

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).

- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) for more info)

- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in the button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at [here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))

-  When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

- Please follow the [PR Template](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to create the PR.

- Always create PR to `develop` branch.

- Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- Refer [this](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/Water-Monitoring-System/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
